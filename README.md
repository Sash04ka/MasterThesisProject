# Master Thesis – Application of Machine Learning in Option Pricing

This repository contains the practical implementation for the master's thesis by Aleksandr Shabanov, focused on applying neural networks (specifically MLPs) to price exotic options using the Volatility Feature Approach (VFA).

## 📁 Project Structure

- `code/` – Python scripts for simulation, training, and evaluation
- `notebooks/` – Exploratory data analysis and model testing
- `data/raw/` – Synthetic and market data inputs
- `data/processed/` – Cleaned and structured data
- `results/` – Evaluation outputs and visualizations
- `models/` – Saved neural network models
- `logs/` – Training and experiment logs

## 🧠 Thesis Goals

- Simulate exotic options data using the Bates model with jumps
- Train neural networks on volatility features
- Compare performance with Monte Carlo simulations

## 🔧 Technologies

- Python 3.12
- PyTorch
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
